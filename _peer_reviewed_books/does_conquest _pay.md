Abstract: An analysis of Germany's occupation of Belgium and Northern France during World War I and nearly all of Europe during World War II, the interwar Allied occupation of the Ruhr, the Japanese empire, and Soviet economic relations with Eastern Europe during the Cold War shows that ruthless invaders can cultivate or exploit conquered industrial societies by  repressing opposition and compelling defeated societies to collaborate politically and economically.
