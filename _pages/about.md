 I am a professor of political science at [Queens College](http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/Political_Science/liberman.html) and the [Graduate Center](https://politicalscience.commons.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/peter-liberman/) of the City University of New York.  My research has focused on military occupation (especially the economic consequences of collaboration and resistance), nuclear proliferation (focusing on South Africa), foreign policy opinion (with a focus on how revenge and emotion affect attitudes about force), and methods of developing undergraduatesâ€™ critical thinking skills.  My research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Homeland Security, Time Sharing Experiments in the Social Sciences, the Carnegie Corporation, the Ploughshares Fund, and the Smith Richardson Foundation.
